# New York

This is going to be my longest one because I was born and raised in New York City but I also went to college upstate at SUNY Geneseo (I'm going to need to come back to this and periodically add to this)

## Born and Raised
I grew up in Queens so while I've always been close to the city, I never really liked going there... mainly because it was always there. I spend most of my time in Queens and Long Island and I'm happy that way.

## College
Going to probably the smallest SUNY in the middle of nowhere was wild. I loved it and hated it at the same time, but I'm grateful for all of the memories I made there. I think living in Geneseo really opened my eyes to how much more there is to New York than just NYC. It really made me want to travel and see what life is like outside of the bubble I was in. It also made me really appreciate the charm and serenity of small towns.

## Other
Something that I really appreciate is the fact that Janice and I have been making yearly road trips up to Geneseo/Rochester every year since 2013. Even post-graduation, we find ourselves going out of our way to stop by Geneseo, even if just for a day trip. We've done the drive through every season and we really get to see everything that New York has to offer outside of the city.

I've been to Buffalo, Rochester, Albany, Syracuse, Ithaca, and some other small towns here and there. I spent a lot of time in Rochester to student teach and to visit while Janice lived there for grad school.

## Favorite Restaurants
- GFR (Geneseo Family Restaurant) - now closed but had the best frittatas a girl could ask for
