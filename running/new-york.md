## Road to 2025 NYC Marathon
I'm doing the 9+1 this year so that I can run the 2025 NYC Marathon. So far I've run a couple of halfs (not any races yet, just 13+ miles for fun on the road) and they aren't terrible, but I heard that the last 10k or so of a marathon is when the marathon actually starts. Spooky! I've only run up to 20.5 miles before and I felt like I was forcing each and every step I was taking, but to be fair, I'm in prep and I didn't carb load so I was already running on fumes...

I signed up for my 9 races and volunteered at the United Half for my +1!!

I've been running from Fort Totten, along Cross Island, to Alley Pond Park, then Cunningham Park and back. When I run near home, I just run around my local park. If I take a very specific route and go through all of the long paths, I can stretch it to a 5k but I only run there if I really don't want to drive out to Fort Totten.
