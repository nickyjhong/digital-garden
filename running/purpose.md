# Purpose

This is mostly to keep track of my running. I went from not running at all to signing up for marathons in a matter of a couple of months and I'm honestly so excited. It's so amazing what the human body can do and I'm so grateful to have a body that is able to do this. 

I also realized that I don't really care about time (or at least that's what I'm saying as of 3/22/2024) and I'm doing it for funsies. I want to run a half or full marathon in every state, and I've also been thinking about ultras because slower pace and longer distance sounds much more fun than finishing with a time goal... I also change my mind every other day about what I want so I'm probably going to read this again in the future and be like "what the hell?" 

I signed up for the Honolulu Marathon this year but might sign up for more depending on how prep goes!
