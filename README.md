# digital-garden

Welcome to my digital garden that I'm cultivating with an array of interests, thoughts, and desires. 
I hope to one day turn this into an actual website, even if it's just for me to see. For now, it'll just be a collection of notes and ramblings stuffed into this repo.

Everything is a work in progress but I'm sure it'll turn into something beautiful.
